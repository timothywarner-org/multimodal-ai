# Advanced Copilot Studio Agent Tutorial

This tutorial will guide you through creating an advanced agent in Microsoft Copilot Studio. You will
learn how to integrate external data sources, implement custom actions, and enhance your agent with
advanced AI capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

* Access to Microsoft Copilot Studio.
* Familiarity with basic agent creation in Copilot Studio.
* An Azure subscription with access to Cognitive Services.
* API keys for any external services you plan to integrate.
* A demo environment for testing your agent.

## Step 1: Create a New Advanced Agent

1. Sign in to Microsoft Copilot Studio.
1. Navigate to the **Create** page and select **New Agent**.
1. Provide a name and description for your agent that reflects its advanced capabilities.
1. Use the unified authoring canvas to define your agent's purpose and behavior.

## Step 2: Add Knowledge Sources

1. Go to the **Knowledge Sources** section in the authoring canvas.
1. Add external data sources such as SharePoint, public websites, or uploaded files.
1. Configure the data sources to ensure your agent can access and utilize the information effectively.
1. Test the integration by querying the agent with questions related to the added knowledge.

## Step 3: Implement Custom Actions

1. Navigate to the **Actions** section in the authoring canvas.
1. Create custom actions using Power Automate or Azure Logic Apps.
1. Define the inputs and outputs for each action to ensure seamless integration with your agent.
1. Test the actions by triggering them through the agent's interface.

## Step 4: Enhance with AI Capabilities

1. Integrate Azure Cognitive Services to add advanced AI features such as language understanding,
sentiment analysis, or image recognition.
1. Use the **AI Models** section in Copilot Studio to configure the integration.
1. Train the AI models with relevant data to improve accuracy and performance.
1. Test the AI capabilities by interacting with the agent and evaluating its responses.

## Step 5: Test and Refine Your Agent

1. Open the **Test Agent** pane in Copilot Studio.
1. Interact with your agent using various scenarios to ensure it behaves as expected.
1. Refine the agent's responses, actions, and knowledge sources based on test results.
1. Use the analytics tools in Copilot Studio to monitor the agent's performance and identify areas for
improvement.

## Step 6: Publish and Deploy Your Agent

1. Navigate to the **Publish** section in Copilot Studio.
1. Select **Publish to Production** to make your agent available to end users.
1. Configure the deployment settings, including access permissions and usage limits.
1. Share the deployment link with stakeholders and gather feedback.

## Summary

Congratulations! You have successfully created and deployed an advanced agent in Microsoft Copilot
Studio. Your agent is now equipped with external data integrations, custom actions, and advanced AI
capabilities. Continue exploring additional features to further enhance your agent's functionality.
