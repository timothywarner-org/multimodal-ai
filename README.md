## Session Overview

AI is no longer just about text. Today’s systems can take in words, images, audio, and even live video,
making sense of them all at once. This session unpacks what multimodal AI really means, why it’s such a
leap forward, and how tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Microsoft 365 Copilot are already using it
to transform how we work and create. You’ll get a clear picture of how multimodal models connect data
types, improve reasoning, and bridge the gap between human communication and machine understanding.
We’ll explore where the technology stands today, how the major cloud providers are bringing it to market,
and what real-world solutions look like across industries. Expect demos, visual examples, and a focus on
what’s practical, not theoretical. We’ll close with a live, interactive Q&A, so bring your questions and
curiosity!

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

* Grasp what multimodal AI is and why it matters now.
* Understand how models like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Copilot combine text, vision, and other inputs.
* Recognize industry examples that show how multimodal systems improve insight and automation.
* Identify key considerations—data quality, reliability, bias, and governance—when adopting these tools.
* Begin to explore and experiment within your own workflows and projects.

## Structure

* 45 minutes presentation
