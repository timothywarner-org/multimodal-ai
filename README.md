## Session Overview

AI is no longer just about text. Today's systems can take in words, images, audio, and even live video,
making sense of them all at once. This session focuses on practical applications within the
Microsoft 365 Copilot ecosystem, where you can immediately apply these capabilities. We'll explore how
Copilot in Microsoft 365 uses multimodal understanding to enhance productivity, then examine comparable
examples from Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI to illustrate how different approaches solve similar
challenges. You'll gain a clear understanding of multimodal AI fundamentals, see real-world workflows,
and learn key governance and ethical considerations. Expect practical demos, industry examples, and
hands-on guidance you can use immediately. We'll close with an interactive Q&A session.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will be able to:

* Understand what multimodal AI is and why it's essential for modern knowledge work.
* Leverage Microsoft 365 Copilot's multimodal capabilities to enhance productivity with text,
images, and data.
* Recognize how similar multimodal approaches work across Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI platforms
for broader perspective.
* Identify practical use cases and integration patterns within your Microsoft 365 environment.
* Apply governance, responsible AI, and ethical considerations when deploying multimodal AI solutions.
* Begin experimenting with multimodal capabilities in your organization's Microsoft 365 workflow.
