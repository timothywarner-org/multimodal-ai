# Security Policy

## Reporting

If you discover a security issue, email **<timothywarner316@gmail.com>** with details and a way to
reproduce. Please avoid filing public issues for vulnerabilities.

## Scope

This repository contains documentation, prompts, and workflow configs. There is no runtime service
or customer data here, but sensitive information may still appear in examples or links.

## Expectations

* Do not include exploits or payloads that could harm contributor systems.
* Mask secrets, tokens, and personal data in reports.
* If a report involves a third-party link or asset, note the source.

## Response

We aim to acknowledge reports within 5 business days. After validation, we will document fixes in
commit messages or PRs and credit reporters if desired.
